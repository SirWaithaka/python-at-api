# AfricasTalking Python Gateway
This is a lone project on making AT's Gateway more portable and readable, atleast for me.

### Aims
Make a more portable python API to interface with AfricasTalking web API.

### Note
This would increase the number of lines of code for AT gateway but atleast much better to work with in future.

### Wishes
Wish I will achieve what i have in mind, and this not be another random project.
